## Info about the mod
It removes and adds small changes that makes Vivaldi (in my opinion) look much better! While keeping the Vivaldi look.

It also adds some smaller stuff like:
- Rounds some Ui stuff depending on the theme
- Animations hovering effects
- BETTER TRANSPARENCY SUPPORT!
- Linux titlebar buttons

> [!note]
> This mod *should* be compatible with any theme but some things may look out of place depending on the theme.

> [!WARNING]
> May have some visual bugs and may break with updates!
